There are very few people in comparison with the land mass available and they are all verry spread out. Civilization stays to the edge of the forest because the deeper into the forest you go the bigger the baddies are.

The majority of maps, and consequently the general populations knowledge of what exists on the island, stop before getting to the center of the Island. 

The maps don't do the edge of the world justice. The northern edge of the island drops off to the abys but in the other three cardinal directions you must sail for a while before you encounter the edge.
