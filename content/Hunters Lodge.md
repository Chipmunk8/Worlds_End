This is the birth place of [[The Hunters]]. It is also their main base of operations.

Hunters Lodge got its name from the hunters. They set up here and then people started building among those same ruins because it was relatively safe. When asked where they lived people would say "Near the Hunter's Lodge" which eventually evolved into a town name.
