The Hunters were created to hunt the things that, if left undisturbed, would eventually hunt us.

They are not a law enforcing agency, though they occasionally take a bounty hunting contract, and must abide by the laws of whatever land they find themselves in. 

# Hierarchy
### Head of the Hunt
There is only one Head of the Hunt. Their job is to stay in [[Hunters Lodge]] and administer to the clerical aspects of the Hunters. He goes through the petitions sent to the hunters by towns, settlements, and individuals and decides which hunters to assign them to. He is also in charge of all recruiting trials.

The current head of the hunt is a Kenku Named Caw Wind-Whistle.

### Lodge Lead
There are four Lodge Leads one in each of the Loges and they are the ones to actually deliver any information passed to them by the Head of the Hunt. They review members and decide how many recruits are needed and who gets to advance in rank. 
### Arrow Head
A full Hunter who has proven capable in any situation and trusted to do all that is needed to secure the future safety of all of civilization
### Fletching 
No longer in training and can take individual missions.
### Nock
New Hunters in training. They have passed their trials and now accompany an Arrow Head until the Lodge Leads think them sufficiently trained.

# Hunters Symbol
Each hunter, once they are made a Nock, receives a Hunters Symbol of their choice. It could be any thing from a ring to a tattoo to a necklace or anything else they chose. This symbol is enchanted and cannot be removed by anyone other that the hunter. It also serves the purpose of notifying the hunter when they need to visit the closest Lodge for information or reassignment.

The hunter may be notified by a ringing in their ears or their symbol feeling hot (the actual temperature doesn't change).

# Hunters Mount
Once a hunter becomes a Fletching, they receive a ######. ###### are the choice mount for Hunters. This is because Hunters prioritize speed and agility to carry capacity. They also can have sap rubbed into their feathers to prevent acid damage, though they still need a hood and leg raps for light storms and full shelter for heavy ones. A hunter only ever receives one ###### from the Hunter Organization.
