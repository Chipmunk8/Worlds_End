While all four seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall) exist, Winter is mild and short lived, while summer and spring are hard to distinguish. On average, it is hot and rainy. Throughout the Spring the waters can be dangerous because the tide is constantly flowing towards the edge and the closer you get the stronger it is. In the summer the rain slows down enough that the edges of the island are still swampy and covered in marshes, but sailing looses most of its danger. Starting in the fall and continuing throughout winter, the marshes and swamps on the edge of the island dry up and make travel on foot a little easier. 

# Acid Rain
The one oddity to the weather is the ni-unpredictable acid rain. It eats through most clothing and metal so most protect what they can under stone. Most plant life is unaffected by the rain and it has been discovered that if you take the sap from trees immediately after an acid rain and rub it into cloth, it will make the cloth resistant to the acid for a time, though the sap won't stick to metal or leather.

A few minuets before the rain arrives certain birds make warning calls and a faint vinegar like smell hangs in the air letting all know to find shelter.

### Sap Cloaks
A garment specifically made to protect the wearer from acid rain. While not perfect it is preferable to nothing.

They are made by taking a cloak and rubbing a thick layer of sap into it, then adding bone or precious metals to the top of the head and shoulders to prevent the majority of the ware. Less effective alternatives for bone and precious metals are natural things like dense foliage or wood. These materials while easier to find don't last nearly as long and need more maintenance. They are also fairly expensive due to the difficulty of making them and finding the right materials.
