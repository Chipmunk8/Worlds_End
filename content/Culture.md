Civilizations are very tribal and family focused. It is not uncommon for a couple mothers in the town to take on the roll of watching the children while the rest of the parents in the town go out to perform their chores.

# Odd to us - Normal to them.
Inns aren't a thing because travel is uncommon. The only ones who are likely to leave the comfort of the town ever in their life are Hunters and the occasional trader.

When There is a traveler, they will often go to the local tavern and ask the bar keep if he knows of any one willing to keep them in their home for the time they will be staying in town. It is not uncommon for citizens to notify their local Bar keep that they have a few rooms open to a paying traveler.

In order to avoid needing to completely rebuild cities from stone, towns are set up in the ruins of a long dead civilization.

# Death and Deity
While no official God is worshiped at a dedicated alter, there are many different beliefs found on the island. A common theme among those beliefs is that death is not the end and performing a ritual for death is common.

When someone dies, and a body can be recovered, they are preserved until the next acid rain where the the body and any significant belongings to the person will be placed on a stone altar. There the acid will cleanse the bones of flesh and leave the skeleton untouched. The family will then use the bones by drying them then smashing them into a powder and using it to paint themselves with symbols of morning.

# Celebrations 
There are few holidays in this world but one event that is celebrated across all four major towns is the Hunters Gathering.

In each lodge there is a magic circle that gets recharged by celestial alignments every 3 years. Kept for emergency's, if unused the excess magic could ruin the circles. So if nothing caused the portals to be used throughout that time, they are opened and all four major towns can trade goods and information for a week before the portals are closed once more. During this festival hunters gather to trade stories and obtain new assignments.

There is also an annual celebration Held in each major town at the same time the Hunters Gathering is held. While much less popular, there are still a few people who travel to a major town to be a part of the festivities.

# Education
Most gain an education from their parents or a village story teller (often an older member of the council - see [[Politics]]). There are no official schools though there are scholars and it isn't uncommon for a bright young person to study under a well known scholar.

# Currency
Coins made of precious metals with holes through the center is the mane currency used. While no vendor would deny a transaction of coin, it isn't uncommon to prefer a trade of goods in stead. 

Most who carry coins do so on a string or necklace with the coins threaded onto the string and a large bead or rock on one end.
