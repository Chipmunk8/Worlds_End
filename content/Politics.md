There is no centralized government and each town varies a little on how it is governed. Most rule off of  some kind of matriarchy and by council rather than monarchy. Here I list the exceptions because that is more interesting.

# [[Hunters Lodge]]
Here the Head of the Hunt (See [[The Hunters]]) is officially the lead member of the council though at the time this story takes place it is common for him to forgo that part of his duties, leaving the rule to rest of the council. The counsel is also not restricted to only females.

# [[Wolf Pine]]
There is no single member of the counsel who is more important than the others.

# [[Outlook]]
One of the council members is placed as "the crown". They have final say on any matter that the rest of the council can't come to a decision on. They are also the one who decides punishment for those who break the law.

"The crown" can be overthrown by unanimous vote in the council

# [[Marshtock]]
The odd one out, [[Marshtock]] runs off of a typical monarchy with a king and all.

At the moment the kings name is Ethan Marshtock, and for the most part he is a good guy. He grew up on riches, so he is a bit stuck up but he does a good job ruling.
