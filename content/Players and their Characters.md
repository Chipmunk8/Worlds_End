# {Character Name} Scott
Human Fighter

Rank: Arrowhead

Sorin Stormweave is an average looking guy. Black hair, plain complexion, and the likes of nobody special. He wears a very worn blue cloak over his tribal clothing to hide the many burns and parts of his face that were melted away during an acid rain catastrophe. Vines, flowers, and leaves creep across his slightly greyed skin. He carries with him a whip made from the very plants that sustain him as well as a shield made from stone, which is also covered in plant life. 

His hunters symbol is a wolf claw from his first kill. He has ornate carvings in the claw and wears it as an earring.
