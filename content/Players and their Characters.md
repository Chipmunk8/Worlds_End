#  Pip (Kaya)
Human Artificer

Rank: Fletching

Pip (no last name), is small. To say the least. Probably 4'8" ~ 4'10", but no ones really gotten close enough to check. (It's sort of a joke within the small circle of acquaintances she has, to see who can finally put this dispute to rest. No one has succeeded... yet) Other than her stature, she has mousey brown-grey hair only down to her chin. Her eyes are that strange grey-green-blue that depends on her surroundings. The most striking thing about her is the company she keeps, in particular 3... penguins? One penguin almost her size, 3'6" and two others, about 1'6". Her outfits are normally bright and baggy with some east Asian influence, and she is constantly seen with a hair ornament tassel with a small, silent bell. This is commonly believed to be her hunters symbol. She is probably in her late teens or early twenties.

# Sorin Stormweave (Scott)
Human Fighter

Rank: Arrowhead

Sorin Stormweave is an average looking guy. Black hair, plain complexion, and the likes of nobody special. He wears a very worn blue cloak over his tribal clothing to hide the many burns and parts of his face that were melted away during an acid rain catastrophe. Vines, flowers, and leaves creep across his slightly greyed skin. He carries with him a whip made from the very plants that sustain him as well as a shield made from stone, which is also covered in plant life. 

His hunters symbol is a wolf claw from his first kill. He has ornate carvings in the claw and wears it as an earring.
